    <p>something?</p>
     we feel,
Maccabi Tel Aviv, our love is real.

(Verse 2)
Through the highs and through the lows,
Our devotion always shows,
In the stands, we sing your name,
Together, we ignite the flame.

(Chorus)
Maccabi, Maccabi, hear our cheer,
With every game, we're always near,
The champions, the pride we feel,
Maccabi Tel Aviv, our love is real.

(Bridge)
With every goal and every pass,
Our hearts beat in unison, steadfast,
Forever loyal, forever true,
Maccabi, we're always here for you.

(Chorus)
Maccabi, Maccabi, hear our cheer,
With every game, we're always near,
The champions, the pride we feel,
Maccabi Tel Aviv, our love is real.

(Outro)
So let the colors fly so high,
Maccabi Tel Aviv, until we die,
Our anthem roars, loud and clear,
Maccabi, we'll always be here.
